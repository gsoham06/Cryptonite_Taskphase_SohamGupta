Digesting Documentation

1. Learning from Documentation
Proper specification of arguments to commands and programs is very important to ensure correct working. Passed --giveflag as an argument to the program /challenge/challenge.

2. Learning complex usage
Sometimes we may need to pass arguments to arguments. In this challenge we had to pass location of flag as argument to argument --printfile. Used find "flag" to first find where flag was.

3. Reading manuals
Using man with any command gives us the manual of that command. Very helpful tool since using commands sometimes gets complicated and hard to remember.

4. Searching for manuals
man man gives us the manual of the man command itself. It shows us all the advanced usages of man. Used --regex argument with "challenge" to find flag.

5. Helpful programs
Not all programs have a manual. But if we use -h or --help as an argument with those programs they often tell us how to use them. Here the program was /challenge/challenge and argument was -h. It told us to pass -p as an argument first to get the secret key and then -g with the key to give us the flag.

6. Help for Builtins
Some commands are builtin the shell. They are run like commands but handled internally. We don't use man or -h with builtins, instead we use help. Just using help will give list of builtin commands and using help with a specific one will help you with that command only.
