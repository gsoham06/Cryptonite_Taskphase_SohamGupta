Chaining Commands

1. Chaining with Semicolons
We can chain commands in one line by using a semicolon to separate them

2. Your First Shell Script
To simplify changing commands, we can put these commands in a file called a shell script and then run the commands by executing the file.

3. Redirecting Script Output
In this challenge we had to pipe the output of script.

4. Executable Shell Scripts
We can run a shell script without invoking bash. We just need to make the file executable.
